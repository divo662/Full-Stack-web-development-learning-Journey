# Full-Stack Web Development Journey

This repository documents my journey learning and strengthening my full-stack web development skills, starting from JavaScript fundamentals and progressing into frontend frameworks, backend development, databases, and real-world projects.

I’m currently learning using my phone and documenting my progress through code, notes. This repo is not about perfection. It’s about consistency, growth, and real learning.
