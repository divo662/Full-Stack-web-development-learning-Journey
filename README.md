# Full-Stack Web Development Journey

This repository documents my journey learning and strengthening my full-stack web development skills, starting from JavaScript fundamentals and progressing into frontend frameworks, backend development, databases, and real-world projects.

I’m currently learning using my phone and documenting my progress through code, notes, and short videos. This repo is not about perfection. It’s about consistency, growth, and real learning.

More chapters coming as I progress into arrays, functions, DOM, frontend frameworks, backend APIs, and databases.

Notes

Mistakes are expected and part of the learning process. Code here reflects real practice sessions, not polished tutorials.
